            <h3>Dubai Metro</h3>
            <p>The Dubai metro is a fast railway network that is located in the centre of Dubai. The Dubai metro and the Dubai tram is very different because although they look the same they operate differently the metro travels a larger area compared to the tram it only covers a small area around Dubai. The metro is a highly advanced railway system and tourists will be able to get to where they need to be at a fast time. The tickets are affordable aswell there around 4 dirhams which is only 86p in pounds so you'll be able to enjoy your smooth metro experience. The Dubai metro is also driverless and fully automated meaning that there doesn't need to be a person driving the Metro which shows how fast we are moving to the future. </p>

              <h3>Dubai Tram</h3>
              <p>After talking about the Dubai Metro I think I should go onto talk about the Dubai tram which is also a great mode of transport however unlike the Dubai Metro it will not cover alot of the area compared to the Metro which can. Also the Tram is much slower than the Metro which can be quite disappointing but it will still take you to where you need to be. Tourists are also able to get themselves a nol card which is a smart card which will enable you to pay for the different transport you have used with a single tap which is easier. </p>

          <div class="col-md-5">
            <h3>Dubai Bus</h3>
            <p>The Dubai bus is also a good transport option if you want to go somewhere that is relatively close and there are different style of buses which are double-decker, articulated and standard which tourists can use to tour around Dubai. The bus tickets are quite expensive but are worth the money because they are fast and get you to your destination without there being any delays. Whilst your on the bus you'll be able to view the different buildings and view the Persian sea as your traveling through Dubai which is a great fun experience. </p>

            <h3>Dubai Taxi</h3>
            <p>Then finally we have the Dubai taxi many tourists use taxis to get around quickly because they want to arrive at their destination quickly and this transport option is probably the most popular because there are many taxi drivers in Dubai and you won't miss them because they will be at your service when you need them. The taxis are really expensive depending on where you are and where you are wanting to go so for example if you live near the beach area then they will charge you alot because many tourists and people are around there.</p>
