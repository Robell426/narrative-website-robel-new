            <p>Dubai, the city that has completely taken the world by storm and has been the city that has completely taken the spotlight from other countries due to their spectacular skyscrapers, ultra luxurious hotels and also their biggest shopping mall called the Dubai mall(this is the biggest in the world!). 
               In addition this city was only built in the last 50 years which is unbelievable because Dubai used to be a desert and the reason why Dubai is wealthy and a utopia is because the late Dubai leader Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum discovered huge amounts of oil which was particularly important in the world and once he discovered that he was able to utalise this resource he began the developemnt of Dubai which is now if we fastforward today a success now. Dubai is home to the worlds largest skyscraper in the world known as the Burj Khalifa which stands at a staggering 830m tall and also Dubai is known for having the only 7 star hotel in the world known as the Burj Al Arab and this is how Dubai are able to increase their tourist population every year. Below you will see the different things that Dubai has to offer which will make you not want to leave.<br></p>
